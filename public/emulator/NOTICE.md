# mGBA WebAssembly runtime

This directory redistributes **@thenick775/mgba-wasm 2.5.1**, a WebAssembly
build of mGBA. The emulator itself is real mGBA; the application does not
implement or impersonate the ARM CPU in JavaScript.

`mgba.wasm` is distributed unmodified. `mgba.js` is the upstream JavaScript
source with the following local changes:

1. `hostIsGameReady()` exposes whether a pthread has started. The host waits
   for the emulation thread before accepting immediate save/state operations.
2. `hostDispose()` stops the game and main loop, unregisters runtime event
   listeners, terminates the worker pool, and closes its audio context.
3. SDL audio callbacks capture their owning audio instance as `activeAudio`
   and ignore events from a previous instance after a cartridge reload. Audio
   teardown also clears `onaudioprocess` before disconnecting its node. This
   prevents delayed Web Audio events from calling freed native audio memory.

The host methods are visibly marked in `mgba.js`; the audio guards can be
located by searching for `activeAudio`. The changes are also licensed under
MPL-2.0. The complete modified JavaScript source is distributed in this file;
the upstream repository and archive above provide the remaining sources and
build instructions. No proprietary game ROMs or Nintendo BIOS are included.

The runtime uses pthreads and must be served with:

```http
Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp
```

Serve the JavaScript and WebAssembly files from the same origin as the app.
ROMs, battery saves, and save states are managed by the application's own
IndexedDB layer. The core's filesystem is deliberately kept in memory.
The application's adapter installs core callbacks synchronously after
`loadGame`, before the next animation frame starts the CPU thread. The
upstream callback-registration function is not synchronized with that thread;
registering callbacks after startup could race the CPU's callback vector.
