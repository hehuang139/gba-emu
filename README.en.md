Advance combines a dark, mint-accented interface with a local game library, save states and keyboard, gamepad and touch controls. The interface is currently in Chinese and adapts to desktop, tablet and phone screens. The bundled mGBA core runs actual GBA code, graphics and audio.

No account or user-supplied BIOS is required. Try **Star Orbit**, an original, MIT-licensed homebrew game included in the repository. No commercial game ROMs are distributed with this project.

## Screenshots

All screenshots show the real application. Game footage comes from the included original homebrew ROM. Alongside the library overview above, the gallery covers saves, controls, settings, help and mobile play.

### 1. Save manager and save states

The save manager collects automatic and manual states across games, with screenshot previews, timestamps and actions to resume, export or delete a state.

![Save manager with automatic and manual states, screenshot previews, resume and export actions](docs/images/save-manager.png)

The in-game save panel provides **one automatic slot and five manual slots**. Save, load, import and export states, or back up and import a game's battery save (`.sav`).

## Features

- **Portable backups:** choose games and optionally include ROMs in a versioned ZIP with SHA-256 checksums. Preview before restoring, match missing ROMs by content, select individual conflicts, and roll back the entire restore on failure. Existing progress is kept by default; unknown or different-core states are unchecked.
- **Real emulation:** mGBA WASM graphics, audio and SRAM / Flash / EEPROM battery saves.
- **Local library:** multiple-file and drag-and-drop imports, search, sorting, favorites, recent play, playtime, grid and list views.
- **ZIP support:** import `.gba` files from nested folders, with content-based deduplication that preserves existing progress.
- **Save states:** five manual slots and one automatic slot, screenshot previews, quick save/load and import/export.
- **Progress management:** automatic states every 30 seconds and when returning to the library or hiding the page, when enabled; `.sav` import/export.
- **Playback:** pause, resume, reset, fullscreen, 1× / 2× / 4× speed, hold-to-fast-forward, hold-to-rewind, volume and mute.
- **Controls:** remappable keyboard; device-specific gamepad button / axis mappings and deadzone; standard / compact touch layouts with adjustable size and opacity.
- **Display:** pixel, smooth and CRT scanline filters; screenshots from the real core framebuffer.
- **Local data:** IndexedDB stores ROMs, library metadata and saves; localStorage stores preferences. Runtime assets are bundled without an external CDN dependency.
- **Homebrew demo:** reproducible ARM code with double-buffered graphics, native input, PSG audio and SRAM saves.

## Quick start

Recommended: **Node.js 24** and **pnpm 11.19.0**. Minimum Node.js version: 22.18. If pnpm is not installed, run `npm install --global pnpm@11.19.0` first.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/hehuang139/gba-emu.git
cd gba-emu
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173). Click **「开始试玩」** to start the demo, or import your own `.gba` / `.zip` file.

In Star Orbit, move toward the gold beacons to collect points. Hold `X` to boost, press `Z` to emit a pulse, and press `Enter` to reset. See the [demo documentation](public/demo/README.md) for its source and build instructions.

## Controls

Launching a game focuses its screen; clicking the screen restores that focus. Gameplay keys and shortcuts apply only while the screen is focused. Use `Esc` or `Shift + Tab` to leave it, then navigate the interface with normal `Tab`, `Enter` and `Space` behavior. Closing a dialog restores its trigger's focus, and exiting a game restores the launch control. Change GBA mappings in controller settings and press `Esc` to cancel capture. Emulator shortcuts remain reserved.

| Action | Default key |
| --- | --- |
| D-pad | Arrow keys |
| GBA A / B | `X` / `Z` |
| GBA L / R | `A` / `S` |
| Start / Select | `Enter` / Right `Shift` |
| Pause / resume | `Space` |
| Save / load manual slot 1 | `F5` / `F8` |
| Temporary 2× speed | Hold `Tab` |
| Rewind | Hold `Backspace` |
| Fullscreen | `F11` |

Standard gamepads retain default face / shoulder / menu buttons, D-pad and left-stick mappings. Press a gamepad button once to make it visible to the browser. In controller settings, select the device, choose a GBA button, then press a physical button or move an axis. Capture can be cancelled, individual mappings cleared and defaults restored. Stick deadzone ranges from 10% to 90%. Nonstandard devices start with no guessed mappings. Profiles persist by browser-provided device identity and layout, independent of connection slot; devices with the same identity and layout share a profile.

Touch settings offer standard / compact layouts, 80%–130% button size and 40%–100% opacity. Settings persist across reloads and older preferences receive safe defaults. Narrow screens constrain actual button size, and styles reserve safe-area spacing. Disconnection, blur, dialogs, pointer cancellation and pause release the relevant input. A key held by several input sources remains pressed until every source releases it. Physical phone, controller and assistive-technology coverage is documented in the [compatibility record](docs/compatibility-matrix.md).

## Import and save limits

Single `.gba` files must be between 192 bytes and 32 MiB. ZIP files may be up to 64 MiB, contain up to 32 games and expand to at most 128 MiB of ROM data. Stored and Deflate compression are supported; encrypted, ZIP64, split and nested ZIP archives are not. Imports verify sizes and CRC values and ignore documentation and macOS metadata.

Battery saves (`.sav`) contain a game's own saved progress. Save states capture the full emulation state and require the matching game and a compatible mGBA version. Clearing site data, ending an incognito session or browser storage eviction can delete local files, so export important saves. Force-closing the browser can lose progress since the last automatic save.

The adapter waits for the current game's first completed frame before allowing save operations. Battery export reads live cartridge save data from a native state snapshot, avoiding stale SRAM when the core has not yet flushed its virtual filesystem. This change does not upgrade the bundled mGBA core or change public `.sav` / save-state formats.

## Deployment

```sh
pnpm build
pnpm preview
```

The output is in `dist/`; local preview runs at [http://localhost:4173](http://localhost:4173).

**The threaded WASM core requires HTTPS or localhost and cross-origin isolation.** Serve these response headers:

```http
Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp
```

Vite development and preview servers already set them. The included `public/_headers` supports compatible Netlify / Cloudflare Pages deployments. Other hosts must configure the headers explicitly. Serve the core and application from the same origin; the current build assumes a site-root deployment.

Plain HTTP on a LAN address and hosts without the required headers will not run the core. Default GitHub Pages hosting does not support these custom response headers and is not a direct deployment target for this version. Browsers need SharedArrayBuffer, WebAssembly threads, WebGL and IndexedDB. PWA installation and reliable offline use are not implemented yet.

## Development and testing

```sh
pnpm test
pnpm build
pnpm exec playwright install chromium

# Keep pnpm dev running in another terminal
pnpm test:engine
pnpm test:ui
pnpm test:zip
pnpm test:saves
pnpm test:keyboard
pnpm test:gamepad
pnpm test:touch
pnpm test:startup
```

Unit tests cover storage, ZIP imports, environment checks, input ownership, preference migration, gamepad / touch configuration and native battery snapshot boundaries and decompression. Browser suites cover real-core execution, state restoration, rewind, live SRAM, worker cleanup, library / save flows, keyboard focus and navigation, synthetic gamepads, touch pointers and narrow / landscape viewports. Startup regression covers failed prerequisites, storage failures, first-frame readiness, timeout and disposal during loading.

Browser tests default to `http://127.0.0.1:5173`; use `ENGINE_TEST_URL` or `UI_TEST_URL` to override it. The engine, gamepad and startup suites require Vite development pages or module instrumentation. `BROWSER_EXECUTABLE_PATH` can select an installed Chromium / Chrome / Edge binary. Synthetic Gamepad API input and mobile viewports do not certify physical controllers, phones, audio quality or screen-reader usability.

The [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) describes the project structure and test workflow in more detail. English Issues and PRs are welcome.

## Roadmap and compatibility

Gamepad and touch customization and keyboard focus improvements are implemented. Remaining work includes physical-device and screen-reader verification, broader browser / low-end-device evidence, bulk backup/restore, PWA support, UI localization and more redistributable homebrew tests. See the [full roadmap](ROADMAP.md) for scope and acceptance goals and the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for release history. The v1.1 validation work remains open where devices or manual evidence are missing; unchecked items are not release-date commitments.

Link play, cheats, cloud sync and GB / GBC are not supported. The project has not been tested against a comprehensive commercial ROM library; individual game compatibility still needs verification.
